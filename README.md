### Goal

Since this project main goal is to teach myself and / or practice frontend development --
usage of code linters, fixers and helpers is *strongly prohibited.* However, since I'm already comfortable
in any type of frontend development, I will use it as it will make me code faster.

In order to get some benefit from this project, I'm practicing [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org),
[GitHub-Cli](https://cli.github.com), and [Vim](https://www.vim.org).
